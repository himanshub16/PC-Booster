# PC-Booster
Boost your PC's performance by running this file!

The Boost.bat file deletes all the temporary files and folders and hence, speeds up the performance of your PC. It uses deltree.bat file (which is a type of function) to delete both, files and folders.

Sometimes, it may show "Unable to access the file as it is being used by another process". So, I would suggest you to run this file on startup so that no such problem occurs.

<h2>How to use?</h2>  
1. Download all these files to your PC and save them in a folder.  
2. Double click on Boost.bat and grant the administration permissions when it asks for it.  
3. That's it! It deletes all your temporary files and your PC is boosted.  

<b>UPDATE:</b> Sometimes, usually on the first run, the script may seem to stop in the Command Prompt Windows, just press ENTER and it will be fine.

You can also use the Event Viewer in Windows to create an event that runs this file on startup.
